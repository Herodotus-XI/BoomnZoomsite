        <p class="text">What can YOU do about the government? Well, it starts off with hiding you data from them by using things like proxies, VPNs, and non-standard communication like XMPP. Using TOR helps massively in reducing your presence, but make sure to seperate your identity well. NEVER login to a clearnet account while on on TOR, this can reveal that you were operating at the same time as any other account you're on. Make sure not to take those DNA test kits either, they make a fortune selling your genetic data to chinese labs and U.S health insurance companies.</p>

        <p class="text">Lets take a moment to never forget how far the internet has came and how much of a tool it is to the government... Moments up, they're still spying on you btw. I say that the internet SHOULD be a place of freedom but we can never truly achieve that, with freedom comes crime, and with crime comes restriction. Moral dillema for you, more freedom for the people, or lower the crime rate through harsher enforcment and policy?</p>

        <p class="text">United States war crimes are such a real issue but who cares, its America right? Let freedom ring and shit like that, but there is an unjustness to it. What the American officials instructed people to carry out in Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan was very far from correct and needs to be shown more. The officials responsible for the innocent deaths of so many and the deaths of the soldiers fighting for a faux cause and patriotism they have for a dying and failing system.</p>
